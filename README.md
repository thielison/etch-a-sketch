# Project: Etch-A-Sketch

The objective of this project was to create a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch, which initially involved creating a 16x16 grid of square divs and implementing a hover effect so that the grid divs change color when the mouse passes over them, leaving a pixelated trail like a pen would.

I achieved this by using JavaScript to create the divs dynamically and setting up event listeners for the hover effect. In addition to this, I added a range input that allows the user to adjust the size of the grid, up to a maximum of 64x64. When the range input is adjusted, the existing grid is removed, and a new grid is generated in the same total space as before.

In addition to the basic requirements, I also added an extra credit feature where each pass through with the mouse changes the color of the square to a completely random RGB value.
